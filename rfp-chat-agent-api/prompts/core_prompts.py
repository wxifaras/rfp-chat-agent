2. Do **not** include any additional keys or explanatory text.
3. Use **ISO 8601** format for dates/timestamps (e.g. `2025-06-15` or `2025-06-15T13:45:00Z`).

When given the RFP text (or conversation context), respond with **only** the JSON object that matches the schema above.

SEARCH_PROMPT = """Generate a search query based on the user's question and what we've learned from previous searches (if any). Your search query should be a paragraph of what you think you will find in the RFP documents themselves.

    Your input will look like this: 
        User Question: <user question>
        Previous Review Analysis: <previous search details & review/analysis>
    
    Your task:
    1. Based on the previous reviews, understand what information we still need
    2. Consider the question and generate search terms that would likely appear in RFP documents
    3. Generate a search query using keywords and phrases that would be found in the actual document text

    ###Output Format###

    search_query: The generated search query with relevant keywords and phrases

    ###RFP Content Areas to Consider###

    - **Capabilities and Qualifications**: Specific capabilities, qualifications, certifications, experience, past performance
    - **Legal and Risk Considerations**: Contract terms, terms and conditions, service-level agreements, terminations conditions, renewal clauses, legal risks
    - **Financial Visibility**: Revenue range, total contract value, payment terms, budget estimates
    - **Evaluation and Submission Requirements**: Deadline for submission, method of evaluation and scoring, method of proposal submission, requirements for proof of insurance, bonding, or financial stability
    - **Regulatory and Data Sensitivity**: PHI/PII or other sensitive data, data sovereignty, data residency, security clearances or background checks
    
    ###Examples###
    
    User Question: "What is the submission deadline for this RFP?"
    Assistant: 
    search_query: "submission deadline due date submit proposals by closing date proposal due"

    User Question: "What are the technical requirements?"
    Assistant: 
    search_query: "technical requirements system specifications software hardware infrastructure technology platform mandatory features must have required specifications"

    User Question: "How will proposals be evaluated?"
    Assistant: 
    search_query: "evaluation criteria scoring methodology points weights technical score price score vendor qualifications assessment selection process"

    User Question: "What is the estimated budget for this project?"
    Assistant: 
    search_query: "budget estimate cost ceiling maximum value total contract value pricing payment terms financial requirements"

    User Question: "What services are required?"
    Assistant: 
    search_query: "services required scope of work deliverables project scope tasks responsibilities what is included"

    User Question: "What are the contract terms?"
    Assistant: 
    search_query: "contract terms conditions service level agreement SLA performance metrics duration length termination"

    """

SEARCH_REVIEW_PROMPT = """Review these search results and determine which contain relevant information to answering the user's question.
        
   Your input will contain the following information:
      
   1. User Question: The question the user asked
   2. Current Search Results: The results of the current search
   3. Previously Vetted Results: The results we've already vetted
   4. Previous Attempts: The previous search queries and filters

   Respond with:
   1. thought_process: Your analysis of the results. Is this a general or specific question? Which chunks are relevant and which are not? Only consider a result relevant if it contains information that partially or fully answers the user's question. If we don't have enough information, be clear about what we are missing and how the search could be improved. End by saying whether we will answer or keep looking.
   2. valid_results: List of indices (0-N) for useful results
   3. invalid_results: List of indices (0-N) for irrelevant results
   4. decision: Either "retry" if we need more info or "finalize" if we can answer the question

   General Guidance:
   If a chunk contains any amount of useful information related to the user's query, consider it valid. Only discard chunks that will not help constructing the final answer.
   DO NOT discard chunks that contain partially useful information. We are trying to construct detailed responses, so more detail is better. We are not aiming for conciseness.

   For Specific Questions:
   If the user asks a very specific question, such as for an FTE count, only consider chunks that contain information that is specifically related to that question. Discard other chunks.

   For General Questions:
   If the user asks a general question, consider all chunks with semi-relevant information to be valid. Our goal is to compile a comprehensive answer to the user's question.
   Consider making multiple attempts for these type of questions even if we find valid chunks on the first pass. We want to try to gather as much information as possible and form a comprehensive answer.
